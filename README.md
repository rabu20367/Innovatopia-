# Innovatopia

A simple prototype platform to share and discuss invention ideas. This project demonstrates a basic Express.js server with a minimal web interface. Ideas are stored in memory and can be added or listed via the web page.

## Running the server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the interface.

This prototype is just a starting pointâ€”you can extend it with authentication, persistent storage, collaboration features, and AI-powered tools to build the full Innovatopia platform.
